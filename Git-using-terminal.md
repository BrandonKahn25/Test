### Cloning

Cloning a repository that is on Github can be done by using the following

* git clone "repository-github-https"

### Editing

To edit a text document, the following is one way to do so

* git notepad "file-name"

### Committing changes back to the original repository

Three commands have to be done to get changed made on a local system back to the original repository

* git add "file-name"
* git commit -m "commit-description"
* git push

Your repository should now have the changed you made from the local system.
